                Welcome to my website. This functions as an expanded resume or portfolio. As well as other things I feel
                like putting on here.
                <p></p>
                <p>Feel free to click on the navbar to get around the site to see different things about me. Maybe you
                  wanna see the what I do for my job, or learn more about the non-profit I'm a part of. You can see that
                  stuff in the tab called "What I'm doing".
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Another option is checking out the "Certifications/Skills" tab where you can see various skills I've
                  picked up through work, school, and hobbying. certifcations that I've successfully completed can be
                  viewed here too.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Or maybe you want to see some of the things I've been involved with in the past. Past jobs? Past
                  experiences? You can find those in the "What I did" tab.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Now if you want to see where I spent a lot of my time studying, going to class, making friends, and
                  incurring debt, take a look at the "Education" tab.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>If youd want to contact me after all that, there will be some info in the "Contact me" tab of
                  the navbar.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>There is also a "Files/Links" tab. Here you can find some various files that I end up adding. This
                  could include my resume and some other items if I get around to adding them.
