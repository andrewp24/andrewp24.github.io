                welcome to my website. this functions as an expanded resume or portfolio. as well as other things i feel
                like putting on here.
                <p></p>
                <p>feel free to click on the navbar to get around the site to see different things about me. maybe you
                  wanna see the what i do for my job, or learn more about the non-profit im a part of. you can see that
                  stuff in the tab called "what im doing".
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>or maybe you want to see some of the things ive been involved with in the past. past jobs? past
                  experiences? you can find those in the "what i did" tab.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>now if you want to see where i spent a lot of my time studying, going to class, making friends, and
                  incurring debt, take a look at the "education" tab.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>if youd want to contact me after all that, there will be some info in the "contact me/links" tab of
                  the navbar.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>there is also a "files" tab. here you can find some various files that i end up adding. this could
                  include my resume and some other items if i get around to adding them.
                </p>
