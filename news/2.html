          <p>I am writing today out of concern due to the outbreak of Coronavirus and how it may impact Guatemala.
            We are aware of at least 6 cases that have already been reported. However, there were many from Guatemala
            that were visiting countries where the virus had already spread. It is anticipated that as these return,
            they will bring the virus with them. For this reason President Alejandro Giammattei on March 16th
            prudently
            announced the closing of borders to many other countries' nationals — including the USA — for the next 15
            days in the hope of slowing the virus's spread.</p>

          <p>Restrictions put in place by Guatemala and the United States will prevent us from visiting in 2020;
            however, we want to do what we can to help our friends in Ipala.</p>

          <p>From our previous visits, we know that the economy in Guatemala cannot withstand this kind of crisis.
            Restricting people to their homes means no income and leads to even less food than they had before the
            Coronavirus Pandemic. But also consider the fact that health care was already an issue in most areas of
            Guatemala, under staffed, small emergency clinics for medical care, and generally very little medicine to
            treat those that have normal day to day issues. Compound that with what this crisis will bring and you
            can see what Ipala is up against. They need our help.</p>

          <p>We are working closely with our Partners in Ipala to determine exactly what their needs will be in the
            immediate future and how we can help there after. We would like to be a part of how our partnership with
            Ipala can help protect the health of the municipality.</p>

          <p>Our hearts are with our friends in Ipala, despite the distance and restrictions.</p>

          <p>So to be of any help to our friends, I need your help to do this. Please consider donating for this
            cause.
            We take credit cards on <a class="text-info" href="/give.html">our website</a> and checks can be mailed
