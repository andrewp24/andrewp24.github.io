Ipala, Guatemala. I first went there.. I think in 2014 or 2015. It was with two my brothers and my dad. It was a lot of fun and a great time learning about the culture. My dad is the pastor at a church in Spencerville, MD. Our church has a relationship with the town of Ipala.. through some people who used to live there and the fact that a nearby city in MD calls Ipala their sister town. <!--more-->


I think i've been there 4 times since then. Each time meeting new people and seeing people I've met on previous trips. But this last year is the one I want to focus on in this post.
