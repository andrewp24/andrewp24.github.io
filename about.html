                        However, our CEO has traveled with the Cedar Ridge Community Church to Ipala Guatemala.
                        They have planted a seed of friendship. Developing relationships with the people there.
                        It is the intent of this Association to build on that example and help spread
                        relationships throughout the region through education and healthy living conditions
                        to the people.</p>
