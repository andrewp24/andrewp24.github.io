                                                        for our friends in Ipala . In March we received a request for
                                                        money to purchase food for 100 people in Ipala that didnâ€™t meet
                                                        the requirements of State sponsored support. The AEHCA board of
                                                        directors met and decided to divert all of our budgeted funds of
                                                        $5,000 in 2020 to providing emergency food support to Ipala.
                                                    </p>
                                                </div>

                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>Our partners in Ipala asked for $1,300 for the first round of emergency food.
                                        They identified those people in need, purchased, and delivered that emergency
                                        food relief.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In July, we received another request for the same amount to help those in
                                        hunger.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We split the cost of funding these two Emergency Food Support events with the
                                        Cedar Ridge Community Church so that we would be able to prolong our support
                                        with existing funds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We had a budget of $5,000 this year and are only about halfway to that goal.
                                        We are aware that Ipala may have a need for at least two and probably more
                                        requests in the future.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We still need your support to reach our goal of $5,000. Please help us by
                                        asking friends and relatives to donate. It is simple and all donations are
                                        tax exempt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our hearts are with our friends in Ipala, despite the distance and restrictions.
                                    </p>

                                        So to be of any help to our friends, I need your help to do this. Please
