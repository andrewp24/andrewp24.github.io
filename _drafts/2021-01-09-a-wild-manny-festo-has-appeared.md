Who is Manny Festo? Not sure but I hear he was seen in either China, Russia, or Venezuela. ðŸ˜‘<!--more-->

So basically just want to get out some of my thoughts on what makes sense to me in terms of economics. A lot of people seem to want the government to be run like a business. One that makes a lot of money. This obviously feeds right into capitalism. Forgive me if I've got this backwords, but essentially.. if a company becomes a monopoly, or constantly gets talked about like one, then they've pretty much won capitalism. 

Let's use Amazon as an example. They found a consumer need, spent years building up infrastructure, and then through various means, were able to capture an enormous amount of customers through a lot of different services. Want food? Amazon Pantry. Want to watch some tv shows or movies? Amazon Prime Video. Want some pharmacy services without leaving your home? Amazon Pharmacy. You can almost do/or find almost anything you want directly on Amazon.

Businesses and Governments have flocked to them as well for their AWS product. Aside from Microsoft's Azure, Google's Cloud Platform, and some other smaller ones, AWS is basically the king of the internet. When AWS goes [down](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet), many businesses feel the affects. Their income streams are remarkable. 

I'd say that if you want a "business person" as the leader of the country, why wouldn't you want someone like Jeff Bezos. Hasn't he won capitalism? Let's take a look at Amazon though. How did they get to where they are today? You probably heard that Jeff bezos created a book store in his garage and that ended up turning into Amazon. Well let's not go thaaaat far back.

A quick google search for how long it took Amazon to become profitable will yeild you some interesting [info](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+long+did+it+take+amazon+to+become+profitable). It took 14 years for Amazon to first turn a profit. They were making millions, 100's of millions, and billions of dollars but were still reporting losses. How can this be? Why would it be smart for a company to lose money? Michael Malone, a writer at ABC News, writes that "Bezos' genius was to recognize that the Internet, combined with the infrastructure (UPS, Fed Ex, etc.) of the modern world, made online shopping for these items not only desirable, but preferable" ([read here](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87393&page=1)). Basically Bezos and team decided that spending a lot of money fleshing out the backend services, the infrastructure, the logistics, then the money would come. People would pay for services that would arrive quicker then a letter from your grandparents. The only way they could have done that, they decided, was to to take the brunt of costs invested in the stuff that people don't see or think about so that they could make their whole chain extremely efficient. They did the same with their AWS offering as well ([read this thread from an OG Amazoner](https://twitter.com/DanRose999/status/1347677585006727168)). They spend a lot of money going a new route that would allow them to profit greatly in the future.

### Now this is what I really want to get to.

I ain't no Economics major, nor political science, so I obviously dont know how this works in real life. In my head, though, it makes a lot of sense. 

Many people (at least the that I see online) who argue for this "no more career politician, we need a business man to run the country" idea, seem to be ones who would also argue for the theory of trickle down economics. While this has been argued against for decades, a recent study has shown some key flaws in the theory. CBS News writes that the study found "the incomes of the rich grew much faster in countries where tax rates were lowered. Instead of trickling down to the middle class, tax cuts for the rich may not accomplish much more than help the rich keep more of their riches and exacerbate income inequality" ([read here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-cuts-rich-50-years-no-trickle-down/)).

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/which-income-class-are-you.aspx) lists that about **81%** of the US (in 2016) are middle or lower class. 81%!

How can we improve our economic standing? It would make sense to me that we give more people the ability to have more access to higher paying and higher skilled jobs. That doesn't mean we shun everyone with "*low skill*" jobs. They're a different and fully needed job in the economy. But giving people the **access and ability** to have higher paying jobs (i.e some STEM industries), to me will enhance not only the US, but the world, as more people who didnt have any oppurtunity to show their abilities can do just that.

### Now this is what I really want to get to^2.

That's right, I'm talking about free college (free medical care as well but that's a different topic. They of course intersect (think people cant afford medical assistance, which alrady drains income, which takes money from education, etc... it compounds) but this is getting long and garbled as it is.). Some arguments I've heard against this are: "but it's too expensive for the government", or "that's what scholarships are for", or "I had to pay my tuition, why can't you kids buckle up and pay it off yourselves. Stop whining." 

The last one is easy. If someone went to college in 2020(4 years, lived on campus, public, no major scholarships), and owed **$80,000**. According to this [calculator](https://www.in2013dollars.com/College-tuition-and-fees/price-inflation/1977-to-2020?amount=5281.88), with data taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, you would have had to pay **$5281.88** in 1977. Take a look [here, though](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_320.asp). In 1977, the **average** 4 year tuition and fees, room and board was **$2,725**. So the cost has moved way past staying with inflation. Besides, I would imagine if you didn't have to pay for your kids' tuition, that would be a plus. Or just seeing kids being able to more easily fulfill their dreams if that involves college.

For the first point, well, I'll start by saying that I am extremely lucky to have been born with the privileges that I have. Not needing to worry about much other thatn school while in school, not worrying about fighting for extra scholarships that would decrease tution, etc. I found a job right after college and am living at home with my parents to use most of my paycheck to pay off my nearly 85k in student loans.

There are thousands of people who to no fault of their own, never have the oppurtunity to get a college degree which is so needed in today's economy. You hear inspirational stories about people who are taking night classes while taking care of their kids and family with 2 jobs. While that is inspirational... should we not try to find a way that makes that scenario obsolete? And if we think that that scenario is necessary in the world we live in, maybe that's the best example of why capitalism isn't the best system. 

Having certain people have a massive advantage to a significant portion of the country, I beleive, just hinders growth. (This might not be a great example, becuase capitalism and cutting things that dont make money, but oh well). Imagine the middle class and the lower class are like the backend technologies of Amazon. The logistics, the servers, etc. While Bezos and Co. spend tons of money on them at the outset to get them going, they knew they were going to be the reason why the company would succeed. Without having the best backend they could have, they would fall behind others who spend the money on them.

If the government were to recognize that the lower class and middle class workers would gain immensely in this economy from having better education without having to put unneeded stress and hardship on their lives, we could help the country thrive so much more. It would cost a lot of money. It would takes years to show a difference. But when we see the outcome of this, everyone's lives should improve. Not just the top 20% or the top 1%, but the top 100%.

We should have a convo about it if you disagree though!

**Disclaimer:** I don't idolize Amazon because of their extremely capitalistic ways of business. As I mentioned.. they're basically 1 of the 5 "winners of capitalism" which is super problematic! I think it is a good example of how business can relate to social needs in some interesting ways, though.
