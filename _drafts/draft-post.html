                                <p>In July of 2018, Our CEO traveled to Ipala and returned with ideas and objectives.
                                    After
                                    coordinating with
                                    all partners involved, it was decided that we would provide funding for projects
                                    within the existing
                                    project
                                    list of the partnerships.</p>

                                <p>Our portion involved purchasing desks for the school at Poza de la Pila, smokeless
                                    stoves for
                                    schools,
                                    and additional books for school shortages. We gathered $2,975 by asking family and
                                    friends to donate
                                    to this
                                    need.</p>

                                <p>In July of 2019, our CEO returned to Ipala and was pleased to see that the money was
                                    well spent.
                                    The school at Poza de la Pila received 23 right hand desks and 7 left hand desks.
                                </p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desk in the front was what was replaced. The desks behind
                                the teacher were the new desks. Not all the desks were replaced. Some
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the
                                desks were in good enough shape to be utilized by other students who didnâ€™t have desks.
                                They need more.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partnership was aware that food preparation by families and brought
                                to
                                the school was causing health issues because of the water &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sources in
                                which the food
                                was cooked.
                                Bringing the food preparation to the school cleared up the health issues for the
                                students and
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teachers,
                                but the cooks were inhaling smoke from firewood a couple hours every day.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitchens had wood burning stoves with no ventilation. So we
                                provided smokeless
                                stoves for the seven
                                schools that the partnership &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been supporting.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The books we had proposed purchasing were purchased by money from Cedar
                                Ridge
                                Community Church, one of
                                our partners. Which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left money we had gathered in 2018 left over.
                                While the CEO was
                                there, he agreed that the money should
                                be spent to aid 3 small &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children who were suffering from malnutrition.
                                There was
                                only enough money left over to provide
                                food for these three for one month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process to get on the Federal
                                support system
                                takes about 3 months. The municipality
                                was going to cover 1 month as well. Our &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partners are going to cover
                                the third month.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much work left to do. Your support in this effort will go a
                                long way in
